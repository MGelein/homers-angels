        <p>The final objective of the Homer Multitext Project, led by Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies, is to digitalize and gather 
		the different texts and scholia of multiple manuscript of the Iliad in one online database: the homermultitext. This online database will 
		enable researchers and students to easily compare the multiforms in the Iliadic text and accounts for the multiformity entailed by 
		an oral tradition. The HMT is an international project contributed to by 
		different universities across the USA and in the Netherlands at Leiden University. (For more information 
		about the HMT Project, click <a href"http://www.homermultitext.org/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>In Leiden this manuscript club is called Homer’s Angels and every week under guidance of prof. dr. Ineke Sluiter 
		and dr. Tazuko van Berkel a group of Classics students gather to digitalize the Venetus A. The Venetus A is the best preserved text of Iliad
		and contains numerous commentaries (scholia) and it is therefore one of the most important sources for the Iliadic text as we know it and
		for ancient scholarship. Last year we worked on parts of book 13 and book 21 of the Iliad and this year 
		we will revise book 10 and start working on our very own Iliad: the Leiden Homer!</p>
		<p>Apart from these sessions we also try to organize HMT Bootcamps a few times a year: a full day of working on
		the HMT project! These bootcamps have become much appreciated meetings not only due to the (semi-traditional) cakes and coffee, 
		but also because of the team spirit they create.</p>
		<p>Each year a delegation of Homer’s Angels will meet with other students and their professors during a two-week summer seminar 
		hosted by the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C. During these seminars participants learn more about the underlying principles 
		of this project while they also try familiarize themselves with the (XML) editing process. Students work in teams to edit 
		a given folio and at the end of the seminar they will also deliver a presentation about one of the difficulties they have come across.</p>
