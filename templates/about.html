	  <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>The Homer Multitext project is an international edition project, led by Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies, 
		that seeks to present the Homeric epics and the Homeric tradition by providing a diplomatic digitized edition
		of Homeric manuscripts. (For more information about the HMT Project, click <a href"http://www.homermultitext.org/">here</a>).</p>
		<p>Homer's Angels represent the Leiden branch of the Homer Multitext project. Every week, together with Prof. dr. Ineke Sluiter 
			and Dr. Tazuko van Berkel, a group of Leiden Classics students (both BA and MA) meets to make a digital edition of
			the Venetus A. The Venetus A, also known as Marciana Library’s codex Gr. Z. 454 (=822), is a 10th-century manuscript
			that contains the oldest complete text of the <i>Iliad</i> that we have today. The 654 folios are esthetically pleasing, 
			surprisingly legible and offer a unique access to centuries of text transmission and reception: 
			they not only constitute one of our most important text witnesses of Homeric epic, but also, in their margins, 
			preserve traces of centuries of Homeric scholarship (scholia), from the earliest scholars in Alexandria in the second century BCE, 
			to intellectuals in Rome and in Byzantium in the middle ages. After having finished portions from book 13 and 
			book 21, we are currently editing book 16. Amongst our future plan is editing our "own" <i>Iliad</i>, the 
			Leidensis Vossianus Graecus 64, the "Leiden Homer". </p>
		<p>Apart from our weekly sessions we occasionally organize HMT Bootcamps where we work for a full day, converting coffee, cakes and scholia
			into XML.</p>
		<p>Each year a delegation of Homer’s Angels will meet with other students and their professors during a two-week summer seminar 
		hosted by the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C. During these seminars participants learn more about the underlying principles 
		of this project, while at the same time familiarizing themselves with the editing process (XML). Students will work in teams to edit 
		a given folio and at the end of the seminar they will deliver a presentation about one of the difficulties they have come across.</p>
